# PDF Processing

The PDF processing functionality is designed to:
- **Load and parse PDF documents** using LangChain’s PDF loader.
- **Process and split text** into manageable chunks that facilitate downstream tasks like vector storage and retrieval.
- **Configure** processing parameters to balance context retention and performance.

## Document Loading

The document loading process involves:
1. **Uploading the PDF**: The user provides a PDF document (via a Streamlit interface or other means).
2. **Loading the PDF**: The application reads the PDF using LangChain’s `UnstructuredPDFLoader`.
3. **Parsing into Text**: The loader extracts raw text from the PDF, which is then passed for further processing.

The following Python code snippet demonstrates the loading process:

```python
def load_pdf(self, file_path: Path) -> List:
    """Load PDF document."""
    try:
        logger.info(f"Loading PDF from {file_path}")
        loader = UnstructuredPDFLoader(str(file_path))
        return loader.load()
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error loading PDF: {e}")
        raise
```

*This method logs the PDF loading operation, handles exceptions, and returns the extracted document data.*

## Chunking Strategy

Once the PDF content is extracted, the text is split into overlapping chunks. This strategy ensures:
- **Manageable chunk sizes** for downstream processing.
- **Context overlap** to maintain continuity and context retention between chunks.
- **Preservation of document structure** during the splitting process.

In the provided script, chunking is handled using the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`. Although the documentation example uses parameters of 1000 characters per chunk with 200 characters overlap, the script sets default values as follows:

- **Chunk Size**: 7500 characters (default)
- **Chunk Overlap**: 100 characters (default)

These parameters can be adjusted based on the document and model requirements.

```python
def __init__(self, chunk_size: int = 7500, chunk_overlap: int = 100):
    self.chunk_size = chunk_size
    self.chunk_overlap = chunk_overlap
    self.splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
        chunk_size=chunk_size,
        chunk_overlap=chunk_overlap
    )
```

*Note: Adjust the parameters as needed to optimize for model capacity and context preservation.*

## Text Processing Pipeline

The text processing workflow consists of four main stages:

1. **Extraction**: Convert the PDF to raw text.
2. **Cleaning**: Remove any artifacts or unwanted formatting that might interfere with text analysis.
3. **Splitting**: Use overlapping chunks to maintain context, as demonstrated in the chunking strategy.
4. **Indexing**: Prepare the chunks for vector storage or further processing in downstream tasks.

The splitting process is encapsulated in the following method:

```python
def split_documents(self, documents: List) -> List:
    """Split documents into chunks."""
    try:
        logger.info("Splitting documents into chunks")
        return self.splitter.split_documents(documents)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error splitting documents: {e}")
        raise
```

*This method logs the operation, handles errors, and returns the text chunks.*

---

## Configuration

The script allows you to configure the following parameters to fine-tune the text processing:

```python
# Default configuration parameters for document processing:
chunk_size = 7500    # Number of characters per chunk (default value)
chunk_overlap = 100  # Overlap between chunks (default value)
```

You can modify these parameters based on:
- **Document length and complexity**
- **Desired balance** between context retention and processing efficiency

## Best Practices

To ensure effective PDF processing, consider the following best practices:

1. **Document Quality**
   - Use searchable PDFs whenever possible.
   - Ensure high scan quality to improve text extraction.
   - Verify the quality of the extracted text.

2. **Chunk Size Considerations**
   - Use larger chunks for preserving detailed context.
   - Consider smaller chunks for precise answer extraction.
   - Balance chunk size according to the capabilities of the processing model.

3. **Memory Management**
   - Monitor RAM usage, especially with larger documents.
   - Adjust the chunk size if memory constraints are encountered.
   - Regularly clean up temporary data collections.
