# RAG Pipeline

The pipeline integrates document retrieval with language model generation to deliver accurate, context-aware responses. The following sections describe the core components, workflow, and configuration details of the implementation. The RAG pipeline combines several processes to transform a user query into a detailed response by performing:

1. **Query Processing:** Receives and processes the user's question.
2. **Document Retrieval:** Searches for relevant text chunks via semantic search.
3. **Context Augmentation:** Assembles retrieved context to enhance the prompt.
4. **Response Generation:** Uses a language model to generate context-aware answers and track sources.

## Components

### 1. Embeddings

- **Purpose:** Convert text chunks into vectors using Nomic's text embeddings.
- **Functionality:** Transforms document segments to enable semantic similarity search.
  
### 2. Vector Store

- **Tool:** ChromaDB is utilized for efficient vector storage.
- **Advantages:**
  - Enables persistent document storage.
  - Supports rapid similarity search.

### 3. Retriever

- **Mechanism:** Multi-query retrieval that employs semantic search.
- **Features:**
  - Aggregates multiple query perspectives.
  - Manages context window effectively.

### 4. Language Model

- **Usage:** Leverages local Ollama models.
- **Outcome:** Generates context-aware responses while providing source attribution.

## Pipeline Flow

The RAG pipeline operates in a series of sequential steps:

1. **User Query:**
   - The system receives the user's question.
   - The query is processed and prepped for retrieval.

2. **Retrieval:**
   - The vector store searches for similar text chunks.
   - Relevant context is assembled based on semantic similarity.

3. **Generation:**
   - The assembled context is injected into a prompt.
   - The language model generates a response.
   - Sources used in generating the response are tracked for attribution.

## Performance Optimization

To ensure efficient and effective operation, the following optimization strategies are employed:

- **Chunk Size Tuning:** Adjust chunk sizes to balance detail and performance.
- **Embedding Quality:** Utilize high-quality embeddings for improved semantic search.
- **Model Selection:** Choose language models based on task requirements and available resources.
- **Memory Management:** Monitor and manage resource usage during processing.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Query Formation:**
   - Formulate clear, specific questions.
   - Ask one question at a time for focused responses.

2. **Model Selection:**
   - Select models that align with the task complexity.
   - Balance between response quality and processing speed.

3. **Context Management:**
   - Regularly monitor the relevance of retrieved context.
   - Adjust retrieval strategies and clean up stale data as needed.

## Python Code Implementation

Below is a sample Python implementation of the RAG pipeline. The code demonstrates setting up the multi-query retriever, configuring the RAG chain, and generating a response from a given question.

```python
"""RAG pipeline implementation."""
import logging
from typing import Any, Dict
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain.retrievers.multi_query import MultiQueryRetriever
from .llm import LLMManager

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class RAGPipeline:
    """Manages the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline."""
    
    def __init__(self, vector_db: Any, llm_manager: LLMManager):
        self.vector_db = vector_db
        self.llm_manager = llm_manager
        self.retriever = self._setup_retriever()
        self.chain = self._setup_chain()
    
    def _setup_retriever(self) -> MultiQueryRetriever:
        """Set up the multi-query retriever."""
        try:
            return MultiQueryRetriever.from_llm(
                retriever=self.vector_db.as_retriever(),
                llm=self.llm_manager.llm,
                prompt=self.llm_manager.get_query_prompt()
            )
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error setting up retriever: {e}")
            raise
    
    def _setup_chain(self) -> Any:
        """Set up the RAG chain."""
        try:
            return (
                {"context": self.retriever, "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
                | self.llm_manager.get_rag_prompt()
                | self.llm_manager.llm
                | StrOutputParser()
            )
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error setting up chain: {e}")
            raise
    
    def get_response(self, question: str) -> str:
        """Get response for a question using the RAG pipeline."""
        try:
            logger.info(f"Getting response for question: {question}")
            return self.chain.invoke(question)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error getting response: {e}")
            raise
```

*Key aspects of the implementation:*

- **Retriever Setup:** Uses `MultiQueryRetriever` to integrate semantic search with multi-query perspectives.
- **Chain Configuration:** Constructs a processing chain that combines context retrieval with the language model using a series of transformations and output parsing.
- **Response Generation:** The `get_response` method processes the question and returns the generated answer while handling exceptions and logging errors.
