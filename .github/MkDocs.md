## Creating a New Project

MkDocs provides a command-line interface to create a new documentation project quickly.

### Steps to Create a New Project

1. **Create a New Project:**  
   Use the following command to generate a new project structure:
   ```bash
   mkdocs new my-project
   ```
   This will create a directory named `my-project` with a basic project structure.

2. **Directory Structure:**  
   Navigate into your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd my-project
   ```

---

## Project Structure

A newly created MkDocs project has a simple structure:

```
my-project/
├── mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file for MkDocs
└── docs/
    └── index.md  # The default Markdown file for your homepage
```

- **mkdocs.yml:**  
  The central configuration file where you define site settings, navigation, theme options, plugins, and more.

- **docs/**  
  This directory holds all your Markdown documentation files. You can create additional Markdown files or subdirectories as needed.

---

## Configuration

The `mkdocs.yml` file is where you configure your site. Here are some common configuration options:

### Basic Structure

```yaml
site_name: My Documentation Site
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - About: about.md
theme: readthedocs
```

### Key Configuration Options

- **site_name:**  
  The name of your documentation site.

- **site_url:**  
  The full URL where your site will be hosted (optional).

- **nav:**  
  Defines the navigation structure. You can nest items to create submenus.

- **theme:**  
  Specifies the theme for your site. MkDocs includes several built-in themes like `mkdocs`, `readthedocs`, etc.

- **plugins:**  
  A list of plugins to extend functionality. For example:
  ```yaml
  plugins:
    - search
  ```

- **extra:**  
  Use this section for custom variables that can be used in your templates:
  ```yaml
  extra:
    social:
      - type: github
        link: https://github.com/yourusername
  ```

## Writing Documentation

MkDocs converts Markdown files located in the `docs/` directory into HTML pages.

### Markdown Tips

- **Headers:**  
  Use `#`, `##`, `###`, etc., to structure your content.
  
- **Links and Images:**  
  Include links and images as you normally would in Markdown.
  
- **Code Blocks:**  
  Use triple backticks (```) for code blocks:
  ```markdown
  ```python
  def hello_world():
      print("Hello, World!")
  ```
  ```

- **Tables and Lists:**  
  Utilize Markdown syntax for tables, bullet lists, and numbered lists.

## Themes and Customization

MkDocs comes with several built-in themes and supports extensive customization.

### Built-in Themes

- **Default Theme:**  
  The default theme is clean and minimalistic.

- **Read the Docs Theme:**  
  Popular for its familiar layout if you’ve used Read the Docs.

### Customizing Themes

You can customize your chosen theme by:

- **Overriding CSS:**  
  Add a custom CSS file and include it in your `mkdocs.yml`:
  ```yaml
  extra_css:
    - 'css/custom.css'
  ```

- **Custom Templates:**  
  Create or override Jinja2 templates if more granular control is needed.

- **Third-party Themes:**  
  There are many third-party themes available which can be installed via pip.

## Serving and Building the Site

MkDocs includes commands for local development and production builds.

### Local Development Server

- **Serve Command:**  
  Run a local server that watches for changes and reloads automatically:
  ```bash
  mkdocs serve
  ```
  The site will typically be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Building the Site

- **Build Command:**  
  Generate static HTML files by running:
  ```bash
  mkdocs build
  ```
  The output will be placed in the `site/` directory.

---

## Deployment

Deploying your MkDocs site is straightforward. Two common methods are:

### GitHub Pages

1. **Configuration:**  
   In your `mkdocs.yml`, add the following line if necessary:
   ```yaml
   site_url: https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Deploy Command:**  
   MkDocs offers a convenient deployment command:
   ```bash
   mkdocs gh-deploy
   ```
   This command builds your site and pushes it to the `gh-pages` branch of your GitHub repository.

### Other Deployment Options

- **Netlify or Vercel:**  
  Deploy by connecting your repository and letting the platform build the site.
  
- **Custom Servers:**  
  Since MkDocs generates static files, you can serve them using any web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx).

## Plugins and Extensions

MkDocs supports a variety of plugins that enhance functionality. Some popular plugins include:

- **mkdocs-material:**  
  A theme that provides a modern, Material Design look.
  
- **mkdocs-search:**  
  Enhances the search functionality of your documentation.
  
- **mkdocs-mermaid2-plugin:**  
  Integrates Mermaid diagrams directly into your Markdown files.

### Adding Plugins

Install a plugin via pip and then add it to your `mkdocs.yml`:
```yaml
plugins:
  - search
  - mermaid2
```

Consult the [MkDocs plugins directory](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/plugins/) for a full list and configuration options.

## Advanced Customizations

For users who need more than the default configuration, MkDocs supports advanced customizations:

### Custom Navigation

You can create complex navigation structures by nesting items in your `mkdocs.yml` file:
```yaml
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - Tutorials:
      - Getting Started: tutorials/getting-started.md
      - Advanced Topics: tutorials/advanced.md
```

### Custom Templates and Jinja2

Override the default templates by creating your own in a directory and then specifying the `theme_dir`:
```yaml
theme:
  name: null
  custom_dir: 'my_custom_theme'
```
This allows for complete control over the generated HTML.

### Integrating with Other Tools

MkDocs can be integrated with continuous integration (CI) tools to automate building and deployment. For instance, you can add a build step in a GitHub Actions workflow:
```yaml
name: Deploy MkDocs

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'
      - name: Install MkDocs
        run: pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
      - name: Build and Deploy
        run: mkdocs gh-deploy --force
```
